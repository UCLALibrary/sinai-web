        <h1>Welcome to the Sinai Palimpsests Research Site</h1>
        <h3>A publication of St. Catherine&apos;s Monastery of the Sinai, Egypt, in collaboration with the UCLA Library and the Early Manuscripts Electronic Library (EMEL).</h3>
        <p>This website provides access to high-quality images created by the Sinai Palimpsests Project, an international effort that with a five-year grant from the Arcadia Fund used multi-spectral imaging to recover the erased layers of writing in seventy-four palimpsest manuscripts kept by the library of St. Catherine&apos;s Monastery. This research site is released for testing by all interested individuals. The project team is working hard to improve your experience. Site enhancements, including the publication of extensive scholarly metadata describing the manuscripts and their erased texts, will be released in early 2018.</p>
        <p>The UCLA Library and EMEL are grateful to the Holy Monastery of Saint Catherine, His Eminence Archbishop Damianos, and the Monastery&apos;s Holy Council.</p>
